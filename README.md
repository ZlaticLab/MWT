# Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT)

## Overview

This is an updated version of the Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT) software, originally developed by Rex Kerr and Nicholas Swierczek at the Janelia Research Campus. The original version can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt/.

Unfortunately, the original version of MWT has become outdated and incompatible with the latest versions of Microsoft Windows and LabVIEW. So, the codebase was updated by [Lakshmi Narayan](lnarayan@nbio.us).

## Installation

### Using pre-built binaries

Run the installer in `builds/My Installer/Volume/` and it should install everything that's needed, including runtime engines.
